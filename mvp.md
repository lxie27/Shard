A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the smallest subset of features that you consider a project to be a success. Consider your game engine a 'startup' where you are building a product that could challenge a game engine company like [Unity3D](https://unity.com/) or Epic's [Unreal engine](https://www.unrealengine.com). The goal of this exercise is to first define what you will be building and give your instructors early on a chance to tell you if you are doing too much or too little work.

Make a list below of the features you consider to be in your MVP. Then make a list of features that are 'stretch goals' that you think you can achieve. You should be able to achieve all of your MVP features, and a partial subset of your stretch goals.

(**TODO**: Edit these)
Option 2: "Shard" 2D physics engine

(MVP) Minimal Subset of features you **will** definitely implement:
- Take in any shape given bounding x & y values, split it into triangles
- Basic physics: gravity, collisions, friction, destruction, etc. that demonstrate how objects interact with each other
- Tech demo showing custom shapes being made in real-time and acting on each other, controllable with mouse

Strecth Goals:
- Puzzle game featuring physics engine as main draw (e.g. brick-breaker)
- Advanced physics: 2.5d physics (z axis, depth)
- Splicing objects, internal forces (ex: clicking the center of a triangle will produce an explosion that fractures it along it's weakest spots and create forces on that triangle)
- Audio!


Note: It is possible you do not hit all of your stretch goals. You should not edit this document to attempt to make your plan look perfect either.
