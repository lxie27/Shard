# Shard
Shard is a niche Python physics library written in C++, binded with pybind11. The main feature of Shard is the ability for shapes to fracture into smaller triangles, thus giving the effect of shards.

## Download the binary:
* You can get the .pyd [here](./Project/EngineLibrary/shard.pyd) , right-click "Save Link As".
* Manually build the binary by navigating to EngineLibrary and run "sh mingw64build.py" in MinGW.

## Documentation
* Access documentation <a href="https://github.com/lxie27/Shard/blob/master/Docs/html/index.html">here</a>

## Post Mortem
* MVP features were not completed. Therefore, the main objective would be to completely implement collsions, then the splicing of shapes. - Estimated time to complete this: 1 week

* After that, the additional features would be looked at. The game that would be implemented with this physics engine would likely be some sort of puzzle game, using the shapes as obstacles and having the player navigate around and through shards of the shapes.
- Estimated time to complete: 3 weeks

* Finally, improving the bounding box collision design to include rotating shapes and Circles, as the current limitation is composite shapes for non-rectangular shapes.
- Estimated time to complete: 2 weeks
